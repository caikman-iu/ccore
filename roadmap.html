    content="Digital Campus Content Systems (formerly Digital Communications Development (DCD)) maintains several applications that provide content for UITS via single-sourcing — which allows authoritative information to be delivered for multiple uses and to multiple destinations — with several more in the queue for future development. Our primary direction for 2019 is to take intentional steps toward integrating these various applications and building a cohesive platform for content management at Indiana University."
